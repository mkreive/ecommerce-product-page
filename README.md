## Overview

My solution for FrontendMentor challenge. Task is to create e-commerce products page. I added gallery, cart, login functionalities.  

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
-   Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
-   Add items to the cart
-   View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

Created this page with Create React app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used to store the data
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) is used for navigating between the different views


### What I learned

Learned to use Google Firebase and React Context. 

### Continued development

Learn to create my own database and replace Firebase.
